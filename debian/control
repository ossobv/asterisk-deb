  * HFC-S/HFC-4S-based ISDN BRI cards (Junghanns.NET, beroNet, Digium etc.)
  * All TDM (FXO/FXS) cards from Digium
  * Various clones of Digium cards such as those by OpenVox
  * Xorcom Astribank USB telephony adapter (http://www.xorcom.com)
  * Voicetronix OpenPCI, OpenLine and OpenSwitch cards
  * CAPI-compatible ISDN cards (using the add-on package chan-capi)
  * Full Duplex Sound Card (ALSA or OSS) supported by Linux

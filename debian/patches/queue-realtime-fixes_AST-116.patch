Subject: realtime app_queue fixes
Bug: GN/AST-116
Date: 2019-12-11
Upstream: no (not yet? not needed?)

Should fix a couple of problems with the Asterisk realtime queue in 11.

Prerequisites:
  * We require the change that the devstate of realtime chan_sip is
    UNKNOWN instead of UNAVAILABLE:

         * Thus, we call for realtime=FALSE and devstate_only=TRUE.
         * Except when rtstatic=yes.  In that case we will skip the
         * realtime lookup altogether because even if we do find it
         * in the DB, we'll know two things: (a) that we didn't have
         * it in memory already (0 calls) and (b) that it exists
        ...
        /* if this is a (uncached) realtime peer, we don't
         * necessarily have an address */
        res = AST_DEVICE_UNKNOWN;

Changes:
  * Adding AST_DEVICE_UNKNOWN to certain places where AST_DEVICE_NOT_INUSE is
    checked. Ideally we wanted chan_sip to return AST_DEVICE_NOT_INUSE where we
    now have it return AST_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, but we wouldn't get that to work.
    (Unsure why. This could use a second glance.)

Realtime queue views:
  * The queue views might now looks like this:
